building the flatbuffers schema:
Rust
flatc --rust -o src/actors messages.fbs

Python
flatc --python -o demo messages.fbs

JavaScript
flatc --js -o static messages.fbs

N.B. flatbuffers.js comes from the flatbuffers git repo, copied here purely for convenience (ref https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/tree/master/js).

Concept: 

(1)
generate flatbuffer message from Python -> switchboard via bus -> determine type -> route to front-end
generate flatbuffer message from JavaScript -> switchboard via socket -> determine type -> route to back-end.

(2) Verify maximum rate at which messages of a representative size can be pushed through the actix framework.
